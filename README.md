# Welcome to the Kata Starter

### For Best Results

1) Install Jetbrains Rider 2019.2.3 (free evaluation).

2) Install Dotnet SDK 2.2.

3) In Rider, install the plugin "Machine Specifications Runner for Rider" (File > Settings > Plugins)

4) Make sure everything compiles and the unit tests run and pass (if the tests do not pass, you need to go back and check your versions. If the versions of Rider, Dotnet Core, and the Machine Specifications plugin are not compatible, the tests will not run).

5) Fork this repo so that you can push back in your changes.
